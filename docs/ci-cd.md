# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the RustEx project, designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments.

## Overview

The RustEx CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple specialized workflows that handle different aspects of the development lifecycle:

- **Continuous Integration** (`ci.yml`) - Core testing and quality checks
- **Security Checks** (`security.yml`) - Vulnerability scanning and compliance
- **Dependency Management** (`dependencies.yml`) - Automated dependency updates
- **Performance Benchmarks** (`benchmarks.yml`) - Performance monitoring and regression detection
- **Release Management** (`release.yml`) - Automated releases and publishing
- **Deployment** (`deploy.yml`) - Environment deployments with rollback capability

## 🔄 Continuous Integration Workflow

### Triggers
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Merge queue events

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Pre-flight Checks
- Code formatting verification (`cargo fmt`)
- Cargo.toml validation
- Typo checking
- Fast-fail for obvious issues

#### 2. Test Matrix
Comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions:

**Operating Systems:**
- Ubuntu Latest (primary)
- Windows Latest
- macOS Latest

**Rust Versions:**
- Stable (primary)
- Beta
- MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version: 1.70.0)
- Nightly (experimental, can fail)

**Features:**
- Build with all features
- Test with all features
- Documentation tests

#### 3. Code Quality
- **Clippy Lints**: Strict linting with pedantic rules
- **Documentation**: Ensure all public APIs are documented
- **Dependency Audit**: Check for vulnerable dependencies

#### 4. Coverage Reporting
- Generate test coverage reports using `cargo-llvm-cov`
- Upload to Codecov for tracking
- HTML reports as artifacts

#### 5. Cross-platform Artifacts
- Build release binaries for all supported platforms
- Integration testing with real projects
- Verify binary functionality

## 🔒 Security Workflow

### Daily Security Scans
Automated security checks run daily at 3 AM UTC:

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Cargo Audit**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Pattern Scanning**: Look for potentially dangerous code patterns
- **Supply Chain**: Verify dependency sources and licenses

#### License Compliance
- Ensure all dependencies use compatible licenses
- Block GPL and other copy-left licenses
- Generate license reports

#### Secrets Detection
- Scan for accidentally committed secrets
- Custom patterns for API keys, tokens, etc.
- TruffleHog integration for comprehensive scanning

### Security Reporting
- Automated security summaries
- PR comments with security status
- Artifact uploads for detailed analysis

## 📦 Dependency Management

### Automated Updates
Weekly dependency updates on Mondays:

#### Update Types
- **Patch Updates**: Automatic, low-risk updates
- **Minor Updates**: Feature additions, backward compatible
- **Major Updates**: Breaking changes, require manual review

#### Process
1. Check for available updates using `cargo-outdated`
2. Perform updates based on specified type
3. Run full test suite to verify compatibility
4. Create PR with detailed changelog
5. Security verification post-update

#### Health Monitoring
- Generate comprehensive dependency health reports
- Track license compliance over time
- Monitor for supply chain vulnerabilities

## 📊 Performance Benchmarking

### Benchmark Categories
Comprehensive performance testing across all critical paths:

#### AST Parsing Performance
- Different code complexities (simple to real-world)
- Throughput measurements (MiB/s)
- Memory usage patterns

#### Complexity Calculation
- Algorithm efficiency testing
- Sub-microsecond performance verification
- Scalability analysis

#### Full Workflow Testing
- End-to-end extraction performance
- Project size scalability
- Memory efficiency validation

### Regression Detection
- Baseline comparisons for performance changes
- Automatic alerts for significant regressions
- Trend analysis and reporting

## 🚀 Release Management

### Automated Releases
Triggered by version tags or manual workflow dispatch:

#### Release Process
1. **Validation**: Version format, tag availability, Cargo.toml consistency
2. **Testing**: Full CI pipeline execution
3. **Building**: Cross-platform binary compilation
4. **Publishing**: 
   - Crates.io publication (in dependency order)
   - GitHub release creation
   - Docker image publishing
5. **Documentation**: Automated docs updates

#### Artifact Management
- Signed release binaries
- SHA256 checksums for verification
- Installation scripts for easy setup

#### Release Notes
- Automated changelog generation
- Performance metrics inclusion
- Installation and upgrade instructions

## 🏗️ Deployment Pipeline

### Environment Strategy
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Live deployment with blue-green strategy

#### Deployment Process
1. **Validation**: Ensure release prerequisites
2. **Pre-deployment Testing**: Full CI pipeline
3. **Staged Deployment**: Deploy to staging first
4. **Smoke Testing**: Verify basic functionality
5. **Production Deployment**: Blue-green deployment
6. **Health Monitoring**: Post-deployment verification
7. **Rollback Capability**: Emergency rollback if needed

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time health checks
- Performance monitoring
- Automatic alerting for issues
- Dashboard for deployment status

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Pull Request Process
1. **Branch Creation**: Feature or fix branches from `main`
2. **Development**: Code changes with tests
3. **PR Creation**: Using provided template
4. **Automated Checks**: Full CI pipeline execution
5. **Code Review**: Peer review using CODEOWNERS
6. **Merge**: Squash and merge to `main`

### Code Review Guidelines
- Focus on correctness, performance, maintainability
- Security considerations
- Test coverage verification
- Documentation completeness
