# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Rust AST Extractor

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** July 10, 2025  
**Project Code Name:** `rustex`  
**Target Release:** Q4 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
The Rust AST Extractor (`rustex`) is a comprehensive, open-source tool designed to extract Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) from Rust projects and convert them into structured formats optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and code analysis applications.

### 1.2 Business Justification
With the rapid growth of AI-powered development tools and the increasing adoption of Rust in systems programming, there's a critical gap in tooling that can efficiently extract and structure Rust code for AI consumption. Current solutions are either too basic, proprietary, or not optimized for modern LLM workflows.

### 1.3 Value Proposition
- **First-class LLM support**: Native optimization for AI/ML workflows
- **Production-grade performance**: Handle enterprise-scale Rust codebases
- **Extensible architecture**: Plugin system for custom analysis
- **Multiple output formats**: JSON, Markdown, GraphQL, and specialized RAG formats
- **Open source**: Community-driven development with MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges
1. **Fragmented tooling**: Existing AST extraction tools are scattered and inconsistent
2. **LLM incompatibility**: Most tools output formats that require significant preprocessing for AI consumption
3. **Performance limitations**: Existing solutions don't scale to large Rust projects (100k+ lines)
4. **Limited metadata**: Current tools miss critical information like documentation, complexity metrics, and dependency relationships
5. **Developer friction**: Complex setup and configuration requirements

### 2.2 Target Users
- **AI/ML Engineers** building code analysis models
- **DevRel Teams** creating documentation and tutorials
- **Code Intelligence Platforms** (GitHub Copilot, Sourcegraph, etc.)
